//! This crate provides a push based XML parser library that
//! adheres to XML5 specification. In other words this library
//! trades well-formedness for error recovery.
//!
//! The idea behind this, was to minimize number of errors from
//! tools that generate XML (e.g. `&#83` won't just return `&#83`
//! as text, but will parse it into `S` ).
//! You can check out full specification [here](https://ygg01.github.io/xml5_draft/).
//!
//! What this library provides is a solid XML parser that can:
//!
//!   * Parse somewhat erroneous XML input
//!   * Provide support for [Numeric character references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_character_reference).
//!   * Provide partial [XML namespace](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/) support.
//!   * Provide full set of SVG/MathML entities
//!
//! What isn't in scope for this library:
//!
//!   * Document Type Definition parsing - this is pretty hard to do right and nowadays, its used
//!
